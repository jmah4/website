            <h3>About Us</h3>
            <p>
                UofT Toastmasters is a public speaking and leadership development club.
                We cultivate a supportive environment where both beginners and experienced speakers can thrive.
                Founded in 2004 as an engineering student club,
                UofT Toastmasters has since expanded to include both students and professionals.
                Over the years, we've helped hundreds of students grow into incredible speakers and live
                as strong leaders. We want to help you realize your full potential as well!
                Associated with Toastmasters International,
                we invite everyone to join us at our regular meetings as guests or members.

                    What's up y'all! I'm an ECE 2T4 + PEY, and I am so thrilled to be your president this term.
                    My favourite part about the club is that it gives me a creative outlet and a way
                    for me to challenge myself and get better at something.
                    In my (limited) free time, I like to watch cartoons and do the crossword.

            <h3>President's Welcome</h3>
            <p>
                Hello! You’re probably here reading this because you’re interested in developing your public speaking skills, and you’re interested in what our club can offer.
                So hi, on behalf of U of T Toastmasters, I’d like to welcome you to our website. 
                On paper, U of T Toastmasters is a public speaking and leadership development club, but in reality, it’s so much more than that.
                While I’ve learned invaluable tips on how to seem more confident on stage and how to deliver a rousing speech, I’ve also gained things that aren’t as easy to advertise.
                I’ve gained a sense of confidence around strangers, lost my fear of awkward silences, and found a creative outlet.
                Toastmasters is what you make of it, and I’ve found it’s contributed an important part to the development of my character.
                But don’t just take it from me, feel free to drop in to one of our meetings.
                I hope that Toastmasters can help you on your personal journey, as it has helped me with mine,
                and we invite you to join our meetings and become part of our Toastmasters family.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jennifer Mah, President of University of Toronto Toastmasters
